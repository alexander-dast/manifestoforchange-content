The idea of the minimum money (or non-monetary provision) a person can survive on is approached in many ways. 

Some would suggest an idea of Universal Basic Income. Others, a minimum wage. In many countries the welfare system aims to provide everyone enough money that they can live in relative comfort, but is often this is manipulated and taken advantage of by bad actors.

A system focused on progress through hard work, aiming for upwards progress, should provide people the basic facilities they need to live and be productive members of society, that is facilities to: eat, sleep, be healthy, and be educated (in forms of houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and other essential institutions). It should likely also provide infrastructure that makes it easier to work, i.e. access to electricity, internet and transport if a competitive market structure isn't efficient.

It should not provide so much that we ignore the human systems that would motivate work for the betterment of society. For example it should not provide the ability to purchase luxuries, and live a higher standard of life, without effort. If too much benefit is provided, people may not bother to do the hard jobs necessary for human progress.
