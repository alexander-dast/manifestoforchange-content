Middle-class and lower-class prospects are becoming increasingly similar.

Wealth changes are increasingly concentrated to those who have pre-existing wealth. Wealth increases generally correlate to capital gains and risk an increasing wealth inequality across the population of the UK. 

Wealth makes up an increasing share of national income.

Preserved wealth does not provide productivity increases or increases to the common standards of life. It doesn't motivate work, innovation, etc. Some wealth is important (think water stored for times of drought).
