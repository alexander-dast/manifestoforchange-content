## Introduction
While there is proposed to be a 'free market' of jobs, in recent years, a much more rigid approach to pay has appeared, where using 'benchmarking' data, companies choose how much to pay their workers. For example, in an engineering company, the pay-setters will acquire (generally purchase) a dataset of salaries for various job types and seniorities. This data is then compared with current salaries of employees, and pay-rises and pay-bands are then set.

This approach is generally proposed as a way to improve pay standards at companies where workers may feel they are paid below average. 

The questions I therefore propose are:
1. whether this effectively creates a situation where companies can afford to give their employees sub-inflation pay rises (or equivalent) as they know from benchmarks that other companies are doing similar
2. are the salaries in companies driving the benchmarks or are the benchmarks driving the salaries?
3. does this provide a competitive market for pay, or cause suppression
4. is this an effective monopoly on salaries?
5. how does this compare to that of public sector pay, where there are no opportunities elsewhere?
