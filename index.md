 *manifestoforchange.org.uk* aims to be a crowdsourced, repository of knowledge, ongoing research, and discussion of real ideas. It should be full of thoughts for how we can enact 'real change' to the system we are in.

Key to this is that prospective collaborators go into the project with a mentality of **ambitious compromise**. 

In effect this means a willingness to accept:
1. we all have ideals that aren't realistic or wouldn't appeal to a majority.
2. there will be a compromise that is still ambitious, and will still create change.
3. change isn't easy and requires work and sacrifice, both in developing the ideas and through implementation

A real issue in discourse at the moment is the ability to accept two things at once. There isn't one clear solution to world issues, no matter how easy it is for us to look for quick fixes.

Ideally this document should be a record of ideas, and the discussion, explanation and research that has gone into making them. The actual process of making that happen is not complete, so some work will have to go into the actual technical side of making this vision possible.
