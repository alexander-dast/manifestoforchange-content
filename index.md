  - Welcome!

 *manifestoforchange.org.uk* aims to be a crowdsourced, repository of knowledge, ongoing research, and discussion of real ideas. It should be full of thoughts for how we can enact 'real change' to the system we live in. It is focused towards the United Kingdom, but really the ideas should be applicable anywhere.

Key to this is that prospective collaborators go into the project with a mentality of **ambitious compromise**. 

To attempt to define what this means:
1. your ideals won't always appeal to the majority and implementation not be feasible at all
2. compromise isn't a bad thing, in fact it means finding a solution that works
3. compromise doesn't have to mean a worse idea, perhaps it even means finding a better solution to a problem.

Change isn't easy and requires work and sacrifice, both in developing the ideas and in the implementation

A real issue in discourse at the moment is the ability to accept two things at once. There isn't one clear solution to world issues, no matter how easy it is for us to look for quick fixes.

Ideally this set of information should be a record of ideas, and the discussion, explanation and research that has gone into making them. The actual process of making that happen is not complete, so some work will have to go into the actual technical side of making this vision possible, read more on this [[README]].

[[Contents]] aims to act as a central list of all key 'policy' / 'discussion' topics, to keep track of important pages.

## Approach
This 'manifesto' is an attempt to provide an balanced political approach to issues, however some would argue the idea of looking for change and improvement for society as a whole is inherently political. 

In relation to this, our argument is that the two arms of political discourse (left vs right) is a distraction to actual progress. To place our approach on an axes is instead of looking left and right, to be looking forwards to creating our shared future, attempting to approach issues for the long-term not just the short-term.

Perhaps this could be described as **pragmatic progressivism**, though bogging ourselves down in political definitions is counter to the mission of change.

## General Todos:
- [ ] Style guide, workout how each page should be structured to keep everything simple
- [ ] Key topics / sections / organisation guide. Attempt to workout how this will be ordered.
      Should things be tagged? How should references be handled? If there are two different approaches for an issue, how can they be linked, and combined.
