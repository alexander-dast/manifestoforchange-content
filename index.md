 *manifestoforchange.org.uk* aims to be a crowdsourced, repository of knowledge, ongoing research, and discussion of real ideas. It should be full of thoughts for how we can enact 'real change' to the system we are in.

Key to this is that prospective collaborators go into the project with a **mentality of** **ambitious compromise**. 

Initially this means a willingness to accept:
1. ideals don't always appeal to a majority and some won't work full stop
2. compromise isn't a bad thing, in fact it means finding a solution that works
3. compromise doesn't have to mean a worse idea, perhaps it even means finding a better solution

Change isn't easy and requires work and sacrifice, both in developing the ideas and through implementation

A real issue in discourse at the moment is the ability to accept two things at once. There isn't one clear solution to world issues, no matter how easy it is for us to look for quick fixes.

Ideally this set of information should be a record of ideas, and the discussion, explanation and research that has gone into making them. The actual process of making that happen is not complete, so some work will have to go into the actual technical side of making this vision possible.
