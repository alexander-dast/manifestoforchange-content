This repository aims to be a set of information compiled based on discussion, research, and many hours of human effort.

All information should be in markdown.md format, with the ability to do more complex syntax such, as $LATEX$,  `code`, add images, diagrams. Ideally different areas are separated in to subdirectories to make it manageable to navigate between. 

Where references are relevant they should be included. Where discussions have been had, archives to the discussion can be linked. Practically, all evidence that shows where conclusions were drawn from should be included.

On manifestoforchange.org.uk, a 'live' navigable website version of this same content will be displayed. It is intended that some form of forum for community discussion will be set up and from that this repository can be updated.

The suggestion for the workflow is:
1. discussion and/or research (on a forum, community chat)
2. a writeup of the key information in a clear and concise format (markdown + attachments)
3. pull request onto the current `v{whatever_version}` branch.
4. regular larger version releases for the 'manifesto' to `main` and indirectly to the website.
This may be subject to change, based on what is simple and works best.
